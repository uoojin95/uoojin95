# Hi there! üëã

My name is Eugene (or Yujin) and I'm a software developer currently living in Toronto, Canada üçÅ.

Right now I'm at [Included Health](https://includedhealth.com/) and we are on a mission to make health care better for everyone.

#### Below are the things that I'm currently focusing on:

- **Deepening my Go expertise**: I'm eager to strengthen my foundation in Go and its ecosystem. If you have any recommendations for excellent resources please don't hesitate to share them.
- **Conquering the Kubernetes World**: While I have a solid grasp of building robust services, the DevOps world presents a unique set of challenges. To become more proficient, I'm actively studying to get CKA and CKAD certifications.
- **Becoming a 100x engineer**: I aspire to positively influence those around me. One way I believe I can achieve this is through effective documentation. I dedicate at least 10% of my work time to writing clear and comprehensive documentation. Additionally, I enjoy studying well-crafted documentation from others.
